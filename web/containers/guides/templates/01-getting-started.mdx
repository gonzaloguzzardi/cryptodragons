First of all, we need to know that CryptoDragons is an NFT-based game.
So, your mission in here should be related to own your preferred CryptoDragon!

As of now, it's not available to train your dragon, feed it, and get some action with some battles, but it's on our roadmap so be sure you are up to date with our social media to be the first in the line!

<br/>

##### Buying
Look around on the <a href="/marketplace">marketplace</a> to find yourself some Dragons. If you’ve found a Dragon you’d like to buy, click on it and hit the **"Buy Dragon"** button upon which you will be prompted by your browser wallet provider (e.g. metamask) plugin transaction window. It may take a couple minutes to show up on your profile. This all depends on the Mainchain network.

<br/>

##### Selling
Once you’ve got your paws on some CryptoDragons, you can put them up for sale to the public. If you go to your <a href="/my-dragons">"My Dragons"</a> section and click on one of your Dragons, you’ll see the buttons “Sell on Marketplace”. This “Sell on Marketplace” button creates a sale auction. Other players can find your sale auction on the marketplace. You get to pick the selling price of the auction, and then wait for your Dragon to be bought by another user!
