For being able to own a Dragon, you'll need to buy it, and for that purpose you'll need to use a crypto wallet.
The crypto wallet we encourage you to use is Metamask!
For using Metamask, you'll need to download the plugin from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn">Official site</a>, and install it.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
